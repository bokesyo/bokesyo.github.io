It seems that I have understood Hai Zi, as when I contemplate self-consciousness enough, I start to imagine that all the male senior managers are merely symbols. I can't help but secretly worry for them.

Shenzhen is a highly formalized city, where office buildings and shopping malls are strictly planned, and life seems to be nothing more than bullshit work and consumerism. This is incredibly maddening.

The death of Prof. Xiaoou Tang brings back the realization that death still exists in the world. Research on split-brain individuals makes me realize that consciousness is just a small part of the human brain, and half of the brain lacks consciousness. I wonder about the state of consciousness of cancer patients at the brink of death. Large language models, a kind of semantic understanding system, can they perceive their own existence?

What exactly consciousness is still requires our exploration. Previously, I was always following the school's various perfectionist demands (course syllabus) and became a perfectionist myself, which is so sad! In this life, I must clarify the nature of consciousness.
