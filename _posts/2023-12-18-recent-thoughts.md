- Shenzhen is a highly formalized city, where office buildings and shopping malls are strictly planned, and life seems to be nothing more than [Bullshit Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) and consumerism. This is incredibly maddening.

- The death of Prof. Xiaoou Tang brings back the realization that death still exists in the world. 

- Research on split-brain individuals makes me realize that consciousness is just a small part of the human brain, and half of the brain lacks consciousness. 

- I wonder about the state of consciousness of cancer patients at the brink of death. 

- Large language models, a kind of semantic understanding system, can they perceive their own existence?

- I learned how to identify those thoughts that we have got used to, from a friend, during 1 year's time. He is genius in analytic philosophy. To think about conciousness and symbolization of people in society/institutions.
