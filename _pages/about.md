I am a 5th-year undergrad @ CUHKSZ. My passion is understanding the ties between learning in neural networks and in biological brain. I love industrial research in that. Additionally, I feel it cool to investigate Chinese dialects. 

## recent work

At [ICBI@SIAT BCBDI](http://bcbdi.siat.ac.cn/), I'm immersed in the realm of brain reconstruction. Based on VISOR2 fast imaging technology developed by ICBI, we can rapidly obtain images of whole mouse / macaque / human brains.

- Pretrained foundation models.
  
- Aligned pretrained model for trustfully stitching task.

- The ultimate aim is to extract whole brain high-resolution circuits.


At [THUNLP@THU](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), my pursuit centers on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capability of large language models.

- Prior to this, I contributed to the creation of BMQA (Big Model for Question Answering, June, 2022) & [UltraLM](https://github.com/thunlp/UltraChat).

- Also contributed to [BMTools](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTools) & [GPT-World](https://github.com/ShengdingHu/GPT-World), where LLMs are treated as intelligent agents.


## research vision

- Understanding large language models' training dynamics, and knowledge storage mechanism.

- Understanding whether there is a matching between biological brain and large language models, by extracting circuits from brain imaging.
