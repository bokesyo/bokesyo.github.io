I am a 5th-year undergrad @ CUHKSZ. My passion is understanding the connection between *learning dynmaics* in deep neural networks and in biological brain && human conciousness. The detailed topics are: training dynmaics of DNN + knowledge storage in large language models; aligning language models for self-perception with robotics; brain imaging & connectomics; neural-engineering. I love industrial research. Additionally, I feel it cool to investigate Chinese dialects and its evolution. 

## recent work

At [ICBI@SIAT BCBDI](https://icbi.siat.ac.cn/), I am developing brain reconstruction infrasturcture. Based on VISOR2 fast imaging technology developed by ICBI, we can rapidly get whole mouse / macaque brain microscopic images.

- I pretrained foundation models with Masked Autoencoders.
  
- I aligned pretrained model for trustful brain reconstruction task.

- I proposed benchmarks to evaluate brain reconstruction performance.

- The ultimate aim is to extract whole brain high-resolution circuits from microscopic images.


At [THUNLP@THU](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), my pursuit centers on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capability of large language models through pretraining and data engineering.

- Prior to this, I contributed to BMQA project (Big Model for Question Answering, June, 2022) & chat language model [UltraLM](https://github.com/thunlp/UltraChat).

- I also contributed to [BMTools](https://github.com/OpenBMB/BMTools) & [GPT-World](https://github.com/ShengdingHu/GPT-World), where LLMs are treated as intelligent agents.
