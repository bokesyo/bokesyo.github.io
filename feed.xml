The cortex, could be represented by multiple neuron cliques, each clique could encode a type of unique feeling, and these cliques could be varying, that means, during learning, the cliques and the number of cliques could change. When multiple cliques activates simutanuously, it could produce different combinations of feelings, that becomes the conciousness. Just like the hidden states of a large language model, usually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4096</code> dimensional, could represent the overall semantic for a sentence or a passage. But now the problem is, how do we <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perceive</code> our own existence? That could be a problem… But the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">perception of our own existence</code> could also be a type of feeling (semantic) composed by a combination of neuron cliques. So, that could provide a possible explanation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conciousness</code> defined above. And the human awareness is nothing different from other mammals or insects. It is just because insects’ brain is not complex enought to perceive their own existence. But the perception is the same.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="thoughts"/><category term="thoughts"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I proposed an explanation for conciousness in cerebral cortex, building a link between language models and human brains.]]></summary></entry></feed>
